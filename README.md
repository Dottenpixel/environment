#My DotFiles!
I keep these here for easy access when I am on a new machine. I hope you find
some things helpful!

##Neovim
I change this constantly as I find new plugins and settings. I recently spent
sometime organizing and commenting. 

##Tmux
Not much has changed here. I added mouse support and also adapted the key
bindings to be more screen like.

##JSHint
You should not be doing javascript development without some kind of static
analysis!

##bin
Shell scripts

##osxSetup.sh
turbo charge your OSX setup!

##git
simple gitconfig

#How to install
Do you trust me? Run `./install.sh`! If not just read `install.sh` to get 
an idea of what you need to do.`
