#My DotFiles!
I keep these here for easy access when I am on a new machine. I hope you find
some things helpful!

##Vim
I change this constantly as I find new plugins and settings. I recently spent
sometime organizing and commenting. 

##Tmux
Not much has changed here. I added mouse support and also adapted the key
bindings to be more screen like.

##Grunt
Automation for my life. Grunt is great for JavaScript project automation. Now I
am using it to automate my life!

Tasks
* Markdown Compile with code highlight
* Live Markdown preview

##JSHint
You should not be doing javascript development without some kind of static
analysis!

##Snippets
Everyone loves snippets!!!!!!! 
Used in VIM for snippet autocomplete

##bin
Shell scripts

##package.json
npm install all your favorite packages into your home directory! Don't forget
to put `~/node_modules/.bin` on your path so you never have to `npm install -g`
anything! 

##osxSetup.sh
turbo charge your OSX setup!

##git
simple gitconfig

#How to install
Do you trust me? Run `./install.sh`! If not just read `install.sh` to get 
an idea of what you need to do.`
